 * of power when not actively transmitting or receiving data. In addition, the Arduino is powered down as well,

 * payloads are currently always routed to the master node, which will wake up intermediary nodes. Routing nodes can be configured
 * to go back to sleep immediately.
 * The displayed millis() count will give an indication of how much a node has been sleeping compared to the others, as millis() will
